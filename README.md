# Machine Learning in Economics
This is the course I teach as an upper level elective at Economics Department of Boston College.

The goal of this course is to provide students with an introduction to modern data-driven learning in a framework that makes it applicable to causal economic analysis. While the course covers the necessary theoretical foundations, the emphasis is placed on application and learning how and when to use these methods, as well as when and how these methods can fail.
